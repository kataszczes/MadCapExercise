        <h1>Why You Should Choose BARF</h1>
        <p>A <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="General.Online"><a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8174467/" MadCap:conditions="General.Online" target="_blank">recent study</a></MadCap:conditionalText><MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="General.Print">recent study</MadCap:conditionalText> conducted in a leading Veterinary journal linked raw food diets with positive side effects such as DNA repair, increased immunity, faster metabolism, and decreased inflammation. Many of the enzymes, amino acids, antioxidants, and vitamins available to dogs in raw food are killed off or damaged during the cooking process, which means your dog is not receiving the full benefits of the food you’re serving.</p>
        <p>Those who oppose raw diets state there is potential for an internal puncture or choking on whole bones. They also point towards bacteria that are resistant to the cooking process. However, according to the Raw Feeding Veterinary Society, every issue presented against raw dog food can be disproved<MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="General.Online"> (<a href="https://cloud.3dissue.net/41890/41651/42148/101874/index.html#" target="_blank">read more</a>)</MadCap:conditionalText>. Although humans tend to compare a dog’s eating experience to their own, they’re entirely different. Dogs know how to eat bones without choking, and they derive huge benefits from doing so. Additionally, the bacteria present in raw foods are highly digestible by dog’s stomachs, which are up to a hundred times more acidic than ours.</p>
        <p>Therefore, if you’re searching for a way to provide the ultimate nutrition for your dog without exposing them to any harmful chemicals or additives, you should feed them raw meals.</p>
