        <h1>Balancing the meals</h1>
        <p>
            <img src="../Resources/Images/doggy-food-chart.png" style="height: auto;float: right;width: 400px;max-width: 400px;clear: both;padding-left: 1rem;margin-left: 1rem;" />The dog food pyramid can be used to help you balance your dog’s meals, or really, make sure you’re not giving them too much or too little of something.</p>
        <p>Much like humans, dogs weren’t designed to eat the same thing every day. By varying their protein sources and all accompanying ingredients, your dog will receive all the proteins, vitamins and minerals required to give them a healthy and full life. Furthermore, receiving their nutrition from a variety of sources will be beneficial for their digestive system.</p>
        <p>Doing your research online, you will find complicated spreadsheets, calculating every trace mineral that your dog should ingest. Let's not get crazy — providing a varied diet, consisting of different types of meat (ideally, at least 5, but not all of them in one meal!),  organs, including secreting organs, optionally fruits and vegetables, eggs and basic supplements (like brewer's yeast, algae and Omega-3 oil), the diet will balance itself. If you provide the right ratio of meat to bone, you usually do not have to worry about the calcium-to-phosphorus ration.</p>
        <p>Also, you do not worry about balancing perfectly every single meal. You can balance the diet over a week or two weeks period, so if you run out of hearts or kidneys, or can only find one type of meat,  your dog will still be fine! You can add the missing offal or more varied meats later in the week.</p>
