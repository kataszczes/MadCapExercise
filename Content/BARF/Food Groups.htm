        <h1>Food Groups</h1>
        <p>  In a nutshell, BARF diet consists of raw muscle meat, organ meat and raw meaty bones, as well as vegetables and fruits while eliminating all processed foods.</p>
        <p>While dogs can eat most of what we eat, there are some exception. Check out <MadCap:xref href="Foods to Avoid.htm" class="outer-row">Foods to Avoid</MadCap:xref>  to see what your dog should stay away from.</p>
        <h3>Meat</h3>
        <p>Meat provides most of the protein your dog needs. Proteins are catalysts for bodily functions and the building blocks of all tissues and organs of your dog’s body, including their muscles, joints, skin, and coat. You’ll also want to include fish in your dog’s diet for those super beneficial Omega–3 fats.</p>
        <p>It’s important to remember that not all protein is equal and the quality of the protein you provide your dog will determine much of their overall health and physiology. For example, protein powder or processed meat meals are not the same quality as fresh steak.</p>
        <h3>Organ Meat</h3>
        <p>Organ meat is like a multivitamin, providing your dog with a significant amount of their recommended minerals and vitamins.</p>
        <p>Liver is the most nutritionally dense organ, but you can use all organs in your dog’s diet — don’t be scared. I know it isn’t particularly glamorous, but organ meats are super healthy and will provide your dog with a huge range of nutrients. Be sure to provide muscular organs (heart, lungs, gizzards, green tripe) as well as secreting organs (kidney, brain, spleen, testicles etc.).</p>
        <h3>Raw, Meaty Bones</h3>
        <p>“Give the dog a bone” is not just an expression – it’s a necessity that many dog owners are unaware of.</p>
        <p>Your dog needs to eat raw, meaty bones for calcium. It helps your dog to grow and is also used to clean their teeth and keep their breath fresh — it’s a dog’s toothbrush. As you might have noticed, dogs don’t chew food. Instead, they need to gnaw to keep their mouth hygienic and healthy.</p>
        <p>Remember to never feed your dog cooked bones as they can splinter in their digestive tract, causing internal damage.</p>
        <h3>Fruit and Vegetable</h3>
        <p>Fruit and vegetables, both raw and cooked, provide your dog with many nutrients that can’t be found in meat.</p>
        <h3>Carbohydrates</h3>
        <p>Nutritionally, dogs don’t need carbohydrates. Although they can still eat them, they shouldn’t have them regularly because they aren’t a natural part of your dog’s diet and, over time, they’ll put your dog’s digestive system under pressure.</p>
        <p>Carbohydrates always need to be cooked and should only really be used if you’re giving your dog leftovers or if you’d occasionally like to bolster their meal. In general, carbohydrates shouldn’t make up more than 10% of their total diet.</p>
        <h3>Other Foods and Supplements</h3>
        <p>You can include such other ingredients like seeds and oils, as well as eggs. They are used to help make a complete and balanced recipe. Oils can be used to slightly increase the fat or energy levels in meals containing lean meats. Eggs are the most bio-available and easily digestible source of protein, so they’re one of the healthiest additions to any dog meal. To avoid any waste, the shells can be used as a source of calcium to help balance meals.</p>
        <p>Supplements that can benefit your dog are, among others, brewer's yeast (source of vitamin B), algae (source of iodine) and fish oil (source of Omega-3 and vitamin D).</p>
