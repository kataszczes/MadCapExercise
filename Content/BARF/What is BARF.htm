        <h1>What is BARF</h1>
        <p><span>BARF</span> stands for <span>B</span>iologically<span> A</span>ppropriate <span>R</span>aw <span>F</span>ood. It is a model of feeding based on the principles of our dog’s evolutionary nutrition and their classification as carnivores.</p>
        <p>Animals are classified, among others, based on the food they eat, into herbivores, omnivores and carnivores. As is commonly known, dogs belong to the latter group. This is indicated by specific eating habits, anatomical structure and the functioning of certain body systems. A dog, however, is not a strictly carnivorous animal, which means that through domestication, it has adapted to a certain extent to digest and absorb nutrients from plant foods. This does not mean that we should classify a dog in a different group of animals. A dog will be able to survive on a plant-based diet, but its life will be of low quality, which can lead to many diseases and unwanted ailments.</p>

        <p>The evidence of the carnivorous nature of dogs is their digestive system:</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: square;">
            <li>
                <p>The concentration of antibacterial enzymes in saliva is 3 times higher than in humans</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Saliva does not contain amylase, which makes it impossible to pre-digest sugars</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Dentition typical of a carnivorous animal</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Strong jaw muscles, without the ability to move it sideways</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Very acidic stomach environment (pH = 1-2)</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Short digestive system</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>No symbiotic bacteria in the stomach</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
