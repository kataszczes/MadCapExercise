        <h1>Foods to Avoid</h1>
        <p>There are very few foods that your dog should avoid, so it's not a lot to remember!</p>
        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/disclaimer-consult-vet.flsnp" />
        <h3>Cooked Bones</h3>
        <p>Due to the cooking process, bones loose moisture and can splinter, which can be extremely harmful to your dog.</p>
        <h3>Chocolate</h3>
        <p>Dark chocolate or chocolate that has high levels of cocoa contains Theobromine, which is highly toxic in large quantities.</p>
        <h3>Grapes and Currants</h3>
        <p>To this day we don't know why or how they affect dogs, but they can cause kidney failure in extremely rare cases.</p>
        <h3>Onions, Leeks and Chives</h3>
        <p>These vegetables contain a toxic compound known as N-propyl disulphide, which can cause anaemia in dogs. It would be hard for your dog to consume enough for it to be a serious issue, but they should be avoided to be on the safe side.</p>
        <h3>Xylitol</h3>
        <p>A human sweetener found in lower quality human products. Avoid.</p>
