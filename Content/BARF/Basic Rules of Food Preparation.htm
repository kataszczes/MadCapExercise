        <p>In order to prevent contamination and risks related to handling of raw meat, you should follow these simple rules to ensure your and your dog's safety.</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: square;">
            <li>
                <p>Hygiene first.</p>
                <ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
                    <li>
                        <p>Remember to wash your hands, kitchen utensils and work surface.</p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Serving.</p>
                <ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
                    <li>
                        <p>Meat can be cut into pieces, and can also be served ground.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Supplements can be sprinkled into the meal or previously mixed with water and added to in this form.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p> Only use meat of quality intended for human consumption!</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Do not serve bare bones, only bones with meat surrounding them.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Do not serve large, weight-bearing bones.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Adjust the bones to the size of the dog.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Cook the vegetables for a long time, until very soft. Additionally, for better digestibility, you can blend them. Fruit can be served raw.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>In recipes without bones, you must always use a calcium supplement, e.g. in the form of eggshell flour.</p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Storing prepped meals</p>
                <ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
                    <li>
                        <p>Meals can be frozen and stored for up to 2 months.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Meals should be frozen in packaging designed for this purpose — food containers, food bags, food jars, etc.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>It is best to defrost meals overnight in the refrigerator.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Defrosted meals can be stored in the refrigerator for a maximum of 2-3 days, but the sooner you use them, the better.</p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
